*The modular switch custom firmware*

**Usage:**

Put `ReiNX` folder on the root of your switch's SD card and run `ReiNX.bin` with your favorite fusee launcher.

**Compiling:**

You'll need devkitpro with devkitARM and run `make`

To compile with Docker, `chmod +x docker-build.sh` and run the shell script `./docker-build.sh`. After that, just check `out` dir. This will compile without requiring installation of DevKit* dependencies.


**Features:**

* Loads all KIPs from `/ReiNX/sysmodules/` directory

* Optional custom kernel/secmon/warmboot

* FS patches on the fly (NCA verify/cmac and optional nogc)

* Exclusive ReiNX sysmodules with built in ES patches
